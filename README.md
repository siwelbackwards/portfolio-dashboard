# Portfolio Management Project

## Overview

This project is part of the MATH4045 Mathematics Group Projects at the University of Nottingham, focusing on the development and evaluation of a portfolio management strategy. Our team won a hypothetical lottery, deciding to invest Â£10M of the winnings into creating and managing a stock portfolio with the aim of achieving significant returns over the next decade.

## Objective

The primary goal is to design, implement, and test a prototype system for portfolio management using real financial market data, with an emphasis on achieving profitability while minimizing the risk of loss. This involves:

- Developing a strategy for selecting stocks.
- Creating an algorithm for regular portfolio adjustments based on market changes.
- Utilizing financial, statistical, and computational techniques to analyze data and optimize portfolio performance.
